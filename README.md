I'm looking for a job; see [my github.io website](https://YawarRaza7349.github.io) or [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/YawarRaza7349) for more information.

# Highlights across GitHub

- [Newly written questions and other adjustments](https://github.com/rit-csc/csc_exam_reviews/commits?author=YawarRaza7349) for the RIT Computer Science Community's mock exams for introductory programming courses
- [A bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3821) for the now-defunct Atom text editor that received a lot of attention â€” 58 comments and a fix from the devs that was completed a year later (luckily unimpeded by my mix up of `<*>` and `<$>`)
- [An accepted fix](https://github.com/scala/scala/issues/4540) to a mathematical definition in the Scala programming language specification
- [An improvement](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues/768) to the documentation of open object types in Reason (an alternative syntax for OCaml)
- [A feature proposal](https://github.com/SMLFamily/Successor-ML/issues/53) for SuccessorML (the updated version of Standard ML), a realistic addition that addresses a concrete use case
- Other contributions to SuccessorML [language](https://github.com/search?q=commenter%3AYawarRaza7349+repo%3ASMLFamily%2FSuccessor-ML&type=issues&s=updated&o=desc) and [library](https://github.com/search?q=commenter%3AYawarRaza7349+repo%3ASMLFamily%2FBasisLibrary&type=issues&s=updated&o=desc) feature request discussions, providing overlooked insights
- [Comments](https://github.com/search?q=commenter%3AYawarRaza7349+repo%3Alawrencecpaulson%2Flawrencecpaulson.github.io&type=issues&s=updated&o=desc) on several posts in the Machine Logic blog, utilizing my background using Coq for programming language semantics
