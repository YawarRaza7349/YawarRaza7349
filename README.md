I'm looking for a job; see [my github.io website](https://YawarRaza7349.github.io) or [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/YawarRaza7349) for more information.

# Highlights across GitHub

- Newly created questions and other adjustments to the RIT Computer Science Community's mock exams for introductory programming courses
- A bug report for the now-defunct Atom text editor that received a lot of attention â€” 58 comments and a fix from the devs completed a year later (luckily unimpeded by my mix up of `<*>` and `<$>`)
- An accepted fix to a mathematical definition in the Scala programming language specification
- An improvement to the documentation of open object types in Reason (an alternative syntax for OCaml)
- A proposed feature for SuccessorML (the extended version of Standard ML), a realistic addition that addresses a concrete use case
- Other contributions to SuccessorML language and library feature request discussions, providing overlooked insights
- Comments on several posts in the Machine Logic blog, based on my background using Coq for programming language semantics
